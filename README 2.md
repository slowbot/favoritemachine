## About

[foundation-boilerplate](http://flexbox.github.io/foundation-boilerplate/) is a collection of useful starter kits to help you prototype with foundation framework faster.
This application is lovely handcrafted with the help of [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and includes my favorite front-end tools.

## About Middleman
